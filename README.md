## Repositories app
An app that displays an 'infinite' list of Github repositories with the help of Jetpack Paging and Kotlin flow.
* Uses the Paging library to load data directly from the backend using provided keys.
* Kotlin flow is used to model the stream of data, in this case a list of repositories, which is computed asynchronously.
* Also featured is a lifecycle aware timer that alerts guests of a fictional prize won after countdown is complete.
* Made in Jetpack Compose.
